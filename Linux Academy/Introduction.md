The Enterprise edition is for business-critical containerised application in production and large-scale.
It provides a support mechanism for issues with the underlying engine as well as deployment challenges.
When using Docker EE, organizations are ensure through Docker certification that applications will work as
expected and have support available if they do not.

Docker EE has three tiers.

The hardware that is supported varies, and is dependent on the operating system.

### Docker Swarm
Is a clustering and scheduling tool for clusters of Docker containers (grouped together as services).
